#ðŸ§  What are Isolates?

In Dart (and therefore Flutter), isolates are independent threads of execution that do not share memory.

Each isolate has its own:

Memory heap (no shared objects between isolates).

Event loop and microtask queue.

Copy of the Dart runtime.



Isolates are true concurrency, unlike async/await or Futures, which only provide cooperative multitasking within a single isolate.


#ðŸ§ How many isolates does a Flutter app run?

When a Flutter application runs, by default there is one primary isolate, the UI isolate aka the main isolate.


This isolate:

Executes your appâ€™s Dart code.

Manages  the build tree, widgets, state, and UI updates.

Communicates with the native layer(i.e. Android or iOS) via platform channels.


In other words, your entire application operates within a single isolate... unless you explicitly request otherwise!

#ðŸ§ When to use isolates?

When a task is CPU-bound and risks blocking animation frames. 
      
Use an isolate for  Image decoding/processing.

Large JSON/XML parsing.

Compression.

Cryptography.

Offline ML inference.

Background task handlers, usually from plugins. (callbacks for alarms, notifications, workmanager, etc)

#ðŸ§  How Isolates communicate?

Isolates do not share memory. Because of that, they canâ€™t directly access or mutate each otherâ€™s variables, objects, or instances. 

They talk to each other by sending messages through ports.

Dart isolates use a message-passing system similar to the actor model (like Erlang or Akka).

A ReceivePort listens for incoming messages in an isolate.

A SendPort is a handle you can pass to another isolate so it can send messages back.

Messages are copied (serialized/deserialized), not shared.

This ensures thread-safety, at the cost of some serialization overhead.
